In crypto, narratives move markets. A narrative is a story that captures attention and drives capital flow - it's the "why" behind why people ape into a token.

## Why Narratives Matter More Than Fundamentals

Traditional markets care about revenue, P/E ratios, and earnings. Crypto - especially memecoins - runs on stories, memes, and collective belief.

Consider: Dogecoin has no utility, no roadmap, no revenue. Yet it reached a $90B market cap. Why? The narrative: "The people's crypto," Elon tweets, the underdog story.

## The Narrative Lifecycle

Every narrative follows a predictable pattern:

1. **Emergence** - A new idea surfaces (AI agents, political tokens, animal metas)
2. **Early Adoption** - Smart money and degens find it first
3. **Viral Spread** - CT picks it up, threads get written, influencers shill
4. **Peak Hype** - Everyone's talking about it, your Uber driver asks about it
5. **Exhaustion** - Attention moves on, bagholders are made

Your edge as a Narrative Front Runner: Catch phases 1-2, ride through 3, exit before 5.

## Types of Narratives

**Macro Narratives** (last weeks to months)
- AI tokens
- Real World Assets (RWA)
- Political/election tokens
- Chain ecosystems (Solana summer, Base season)

**Micro Narratives** (last days to weeks)
- Specific metas (dog coins, cat coins, food tokens)
- Event-driven (Elon tweets, regulatory news)
- Copycat plays (every AI launch after GOAT)

**Flash Narratives** (last hours)
- Breaking news plays
- Viral tweet responses
- Celebrity mentions

## The Narrative Front Runner's Advantage

You're naturally good at:
- Pattern recognition across markets
- Connecting dots others miss
- Moving fast when you see signal

Your challenge:
- Not every narrative plays out
- Being early can mean being wrong
- FOMO into late-stage narratives

The rest of this module will teach you to refine these instincts into a systematic edge.`

      content: `# Finding Narratives Before They Trend

The money is made by being early. But how do you find narratives before everyone else? You need to know where to look and what signals matter.

## The Information Hierarchy

Not all sources are equal. Here's the pecking order:

**Tier 1: Primary Sources (First to know)**
- On-chain data (new token deploys, whale wallets moving)
- Telegram alpha groups (paid and private)
- Discord servers of builders
- Direct relationships with devs/KOLs

**Tier 2: Fast Followers (Minutes to hours behind)**
- Crypto Twitter lists of smart accounts
- Dexscreener/Birdeye trending (filtered properly)
- Telegram channel aggregators

**Tier 3: Mass Awareness (Hours to days behind)**
- Main CT timeline
- YouTube videos
- News articles
- Reddit frontpage

By the time something hits Tier 3, the early move is done. You're either taking profit or becoming exit liquidity.

## Building Your Radar

### Twitter Lists (Essential)

Create separate lists:
- **Smart Money** - Wallets/accounts that are consistently early
- **Builders** - Devs who ship and announce projects
- **Meta Callers** - People who identify trends early (not shillers)
- **Counter-Signals** - Accounts that mark tops (when they shill, you sell)

### On-Chain Tools

- **Birdeye/DexScreener** - New pairs, but filter heavily
- **Cielo/Nansen** - Whale wallet tracking
- **Pump.fun** - Watch what's graduating, not what's launching
- **Bubblemaps** - Check holder distribution before aping

### Telegram

- Join 3-5 quality alpha groups (paid is usually better signal)
- Mute notifications, check 3x daily at set times
- Note: 90% of calls are garbage, you're looking for pattern recognition

## Signal vs. Noise

**Strong Signals (Pay Attention)**
- Multiple smart wallets buying the same token
- A narrative connecting to real-world events
- Organic community forming (not bought engagement)
- Dev has track record of successful launches
- Token surviving multiple dips with holder count growing

**Weak Signals (Usually Noise)**
- Single influencer shill
- "Next 100x" claims
- Airdrop farming activity
- High follower accounts with low engagement
- Paid promotion/sponsored content

## The 3-Source Rule

Before entering any narrative play, confirm with 3 independent sources:

1. **On-chain** - Smart wallets are actually buying
2. **Social** - Organic discussion happening (not just paid shills)
3. **Logical** - The narrative makes sense and has room to grow

If you can't check all 3 boxes, reduce size or skip entirely.

## Timing Your Radar Checks

Narratives don't wait. Build a routine:

- **Morning** (15 min): Check overnight CT, Telegram, new Pump.fun graduates
- **Midday** (10 min): Dexscreener trending, any breaking news
- **Evening** (15 min): Deeper research on anything flagged during day

This isn't about being glued to screens 24/7. It's about structured information gathering.`

      order: 3,
      content: `# Evaluating Narrative Strength

Finding a narrative early is only half the battle. You need to evaluate whether it has legs or will fizzle out. Here's a framework for grading narrative strength.

## The Narrative Strength Framework

Rate each factor 1-5, then total the score:

### 1. Relatability (Can normies understand it?)

- **5** - Instantly understandable (dogs, AI, Elon)
- **3** - Needs some explanation but clicks
- **1** - Only crypto natives get it

Example: "Dog coin" = 5. "Decentralized perpetuals aggregator" = 1.

### 2. Memeability (Can it spread?)

- **5** - Endless meme potential, easy to remix
- **3** - Some meme angles but limited
- **1** - Hard to meme, too serious

Example: PEPE = 5. A governance token = 1.

### 3. Timeliness (Is there a catalyst?)

- **5** - Connected to current events/trending topics
- **3** - Generally relevant but no specific catalyst
- **1** - No clear reason for "why now"

Example: Election tokens during election season = 5.

### 4. Freshness (Is it new?)

- **5** - First of its kind, new meta
- **3** - Fresh take on existing concept
- **1** - Copy of a copy, derivative

Example: First AI agent token = 5. 50th AI agent token = 1.

### 5. Community Potential (Can people identify with it?)

- **5** - Tribal identity, people want to "be" this
- **3** - Interesting but not identity-forming
- **1** - No community angle

Example: "Degen" tokens = 5. Generic animal #47 = 1.

## Scoring

- **20-25**: Strong narrative - size up, conviction play
- **15-19**: Decent narrative - standard position
- **10-14**: Weak narrative - small size or skip
- **Below 10**: Skip entirely

## Case Study: Why GOAT Worked

Let's score the GOAT/AI agent narrative when it emerged:

- **Relatability**: 4 - AI is mainstream, "AI making its own crypto" is wild but understandable
- **Memeability**: 5 - Endless AI memes, "the machines are taking over" jokes
- **Timeliness**: 5 - AI was the biggest tech narrative of 2024
- **Freshness**: 5 - First major AI agent token, completely new concept
- **Community**: 4 - "AI believers" became an identity

**Total: 23/25** - Textbook strong narrative

## Red Flags That Kill Narratives

Even strong-scoring narratives can fail if:

- **Rug history** - Dev or team has rugged before
- **Concentrated supply** - Top 10 wallets hold 30%+
- **Paid shilling** - All early "organic" posts are bought
- **No staying power** - Pump and dump with no community forming
- **Legal risk** - Securities issues, impersonation, copyright

## The "Explain It To Your Friend" Test

If you can't explain why a narrative matters in one sentence to a non-crypto friend, it's probably too niche.

Good: "It's a memecoin for the election - people are betting on who wins."
Bad: "It's a decentralized prediction market aggregator with ve-tokenomics."

Simple narratives spread. Complex narratives stay niche.`

      order: 4,
      content: `# Timing Your Entry

You found a narrative early. You've evaluated it as strong. Now the hardest part: when exactly do you buy?

## The Entry Timing Spectrum

**Too Early**
- Narrative hasn't caught attention yet
- Token is illiquid, high spread
- Risk: It never catches, you're stuck

**Perfect Timing**
- Narrative showing first signs of spread
- Smart money entering but CT hasn't picked up
- Liquidity is buildable, still early

**Too Late**
- Everyone's talking about it
- "Easy money" discourse everywhere
- You're exit liquidity for early buyers

## Entry Signals by Narrative Phase

### Phase 1: Emergence
**When to enter:** Only with small, speculative positions
**Signals:**
- New token/concept you haven't seen before
- 1-2 smart wallets making first buys
- No CT discussion yet

**Risk:** High - most phase 1 plays go to zero

### Phase 2: Early Adoption
**When to enter:** This is your sweet spot - size up here
**Signals:**
- Multiple smart wallets accumulating
- First quality CT posts appearing (not shills)
- Organic community starting to form
- Token has survived 24-48 hours and held

**Risk:** Medium - narrative is validated but still early

### Phase 3: Viral Spread
**When to enter:** Only for momentum trades with tight stops
**Signals:**
- CT timeline full of discussion
- Multiple influencers posting
- "Why didn't I ape" posts appearing
- Rapid price discovery

**Risk:** Medium-high - easy to buy the top

### Phase 4+: Peak and Beyond
**When to enter:** Don't. You're exit liquidity.

## The Dip Entry Strategy

Even in strong narratives, don't chase green candles. Wait for:

1. **First major dip** - Usually 20-40% from local high
2. **Support hold** - Price bounces and holds a level
3. **Volume confirmation** - Buyers stepping in, not just falling knife

Set alerts at key levels instead of watching charts constantly.

## Position Building (Scaling In)

Don't go all-in at once. Build your position:

**Example: $1000 total allocation**
- Entry 1: $300 at first signal (phase 2 confirmation)
- Entry 2: $400 on first dip that holds
- Entry 3: $300 reserved for major dip or never used

This way:
- If it pumps immediately, you're in
- If it dips, you get better average
- If it dies, you didn't go all-in at the top

## The FOMO Override

Your biggest enemy is FOMO. Create rules:

1. **No chasing 100%+ moves** - If it's up 100%+ in a day, wait for a dip or skip
2. **Set a max price** - "I'll enter below $X market cap, otherwise I skip"
3. **Time delay** - Wait 10 minutes after feeling the urge to ape

FOMO entries are almost always your worst entries.

## Journal Your Entries

After each trade, note:
- What phase was the narrative in?
- What signal triggered your entry?
- Did you chase or wait for your setup?
- What would you do differently?

Pattern recognition from your own trades > any alpha call.`

      order: 5,
      content: `# Managing Narrative Positions

You've entered a narrative play. Now what? Narrative trades are volatile - 50% swings are normal. Here's how to manage without going insane.

## The Narrative Volatility Reality

Accept this upfront: narrative tokens swing hard.

**Normal volatility:**
- 20-30% dips during uptrends
- 40-50% dips on broader market red days
- 2-5x on breakout days

If you can't stomach this, reduce position size until you can.

## Position Management Rules

### Rule 1: Define Your Thesis

Before entering, write down:
- Why is this narrative strong?
- What would make me wrong?
- What's my target?

If your thesis is intact, dips are noise. If your thesis breaks, exit regardless of price.

### Rule 2: Size for Survival

Your position size should allow you to:
- Hold through a 50% dip without panic
- Not check the chart every 5 minutes
- Sleep at night

If you're anxious, you're oversized.

### Rule 3: Separate Your Bags

Split your position mentally:

**Core Position (50-70%)**
- This is your long-term narrative bet
- Only sell if thesis breaks or target hit
- Ignore daily volatility

**Trading Position (30-50%)**
- Trade around the core
- Sell some on big pumps
- Buy back on dips
- Take profits into strength

### Rule 4: Set Alerts, Not Watches

Chart-watching leads to emotional decisions. Instead:
- Set alerts at key support/resistance levels
- Set alerts for major % moves (up or down)
- Check 2-3x per day max

The charts will notify you when action is needed.

## What To Do During Dips

When your narrative token dips:

1. **Check the thesis** - Has anything changed fundamentally?
2. **Check the market** - Is everything dipping or just this token?
3. **Check the narrative** - Are people still talking about it?

**If thesis intact:** Consider adding (if you have reserved capital)
**If thesis breaking:** Exit, don't hope

## Signs Your Thesis Is Breaking

Time to reassess or exit:
- Dev rugs or goes silent
- Smart wallets selling (not just taking profit)
- Narrative attention shifting to new thing
- Major red flag revealed (fake team, etc.)
- Token keeps making lower lows with no bounce

## The Mental Game

Narrative positions mess with your head. Remember:
- You don't have to be right every time
- One big winner covers many small losses
- Paper losses aren't real until you sell
- The goal is asymmetric bets, not 100% win rate

When in doubt, reduce size until you can think clearly.`

      readTime: 8,

      order: 6,
      content: `# Exit Strategies for Narratives

The hardest part of narrative trading isn't entry - it's exit. Most traders turn winners into losers by holding too long. Here's how to take profits systematically.

## Why Exits Are Harder Than Entries

- **Greed:** "It could go higher"
- **Ego:** "I'll sell the exact top"
- **FOMO:** "What if it 10x after I sell?"
- **Anchoring:** "I'm not selling until it hits $X"

Accept now: You will never sell the top. The goal is to sell while it's still going up.

## The Narrative Exit Framework

### Strategy 1: Scaled Exit (Recommended)

Sell in chunks as price rises:
- Sell 25% at 2x (you've recovered your initial)
- Sell 25% at 3-4x (guaranteed profit)
- Sell 25% at 5-7x (big win locked in)
- Let 25% ride (your "moonbag")

Example: $1000 position
- $250 out at 2x = $500
- $250 out at 4x = $1000
- $250 out at 6x = $1500
- $250 moonbag = let it ride

You've pulled $3000 on a $1000 investment, with exposure remaining.

### Strategy 2: Target-Based Exit

Set a market cap target based on comparable narratives:
- "If similar narrative X hit $50M, I'll exit 80% at $40M"
- Set sell orders in advance
- Remove emotion from the decision

### Strategy 3: Time-Based Exit

Narratives have lifecycles:
- Most narrative pumps last 3-7 days
- Set a deadline: "If thesis hasn't played out in 2 weeks, exit"
- Don't marry bags hoping for a revival

## Exit Signals (Time to Sell)

**Strong sell signals:**
- Your 2x, 3x, 4x targets hit (take profit!)
- "This is going to 100x" posts from random accounts
- Your non-crypto friends ask about it
- Influencers who usually mark tops are shilling
- Volume declining while price rises
- New narrative emerging and taking attention

**Consider selling signals:**
- Dev dumping tokens
- Major whale taking profits
- Similar competing token launching
- You're checking charts every 10 minutes

## The Moonbag Strategy

Always keep 10-25% as a "moonbag" - a small position you hold long-term.

Why:
- Narratives sometimes have second waves
- Eliminates "what if it kept going" regret
- It's house money, let it ride

Rules for moonbags:
- Only with profits, never with initial capital
- Set and forget (don't watch it daily)
- Accept it could go to zero

## Avoiding Exit Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Moving targets**
- "I'll sell at 5x" becomes "I'll sell at 10x" when you hit 5x
- Solution: Write targets down BEFORE you enter

**Mistake 2: Waiting for even numbers**
- "I'll sell at exactly $1M market cap"
- Solution: Markets don't care about round numbers, sell into strength

**Mistake 3: Revenge trading after selling**
- You sell, it pumps, you buy back higher
- Solution: Once you exit, you're done. Move on.

**Mistake 4: Holding through breakdown**
- Token down 60%, "waiting for recovery"
- Solution: Have a stop loss, accept small losses

## The Exit Journal

After every exit, record:
- Where in the narrative cycle you sold
- Whether you hit your targets
- How you felt (greedy, scared, calm?)
- What you'd do differently

This data is gold for improving future exits.`

      order: 7,
      content: `# Narrative Failures - Learning From Misses

Not every narrative plays out. Even strong-looking setups fail. What separates good traders from broke traders is how they handle losses.

## Why Narratives Fail

### Reason 1: Wrong Timing
- Narrative was real but you were too early
- Market conditions weren't right
- Another narrative sucked up attention

### Reason 2: Weak Execution
- Great idea, bad token (dev rugged, bad tokenomics)
- Too many competing tokens split attention
- Poor memetics - couldn't spread

### Reason 3: External Shocks
- Market crashed and took everything down
- Negative news killed the narrative
- Regulatory threat emerged

### Reason 4: You Misread It
- What looked like signal was noise
- Paid shills fooled you
- Confirmation bias made you ignore red flags

## The 3 Types of Losses

**Type 1: Small Loss (Good)**
- You entered, thesis broke quickly, you exited
- Lost 10-25%
- This is the goal for losses

**Type 2: Medium Loss (Acceptable)**
- You gave it time, it didn't work
- Lost 40-60%
- Hurts but survivable

**Type 3: Catastrophic Loss (Avoid)**
- You held hoping for recovery
- Lost 80-95%
- Position is now nearly worthless

Your job: Keep losses in Type 1-2. Never let losses become Type 3.

## When To Cut Losses

Cut immediately if:
- Dev rugs or shows rug behavior
- Smart wallets dump, not just take profit
- Red flag you missed is revealed
- Your thesis is objectively broken

Cut after time limit if:
- Position has done nothing for 1-2 weeks
- Attention has moved elsewhere
- Opportunity cost of holding > potential upside

## The Sunk Cost Trap

"I'm down 50%, I might as well hold"

This is wrong. Every day you hold a dying token, you're choosing it over cash. Ask yourself:

"If I had cash instead of this position, would I buy this token right now?"

If no, sell.

## Post-Mortem Analysis

After every failed narrative trade, answer:
1. What was my thesis?
2. Why was I wrong?
3. What signals did I miss or ignore?
4. How could I have exited earlier?
5. What's the lesson for next time?

Be brutally honest. Write it down. This is how you improve.

## Common Lessons From Failures

**"I ignored red flags because I wanted it to work"**
→ Write down red flags BEFORE you enter

**"I held too long hoping for recovery"**
→ Set hard stop losses or time limits

**"I chased after it already pumped"**
→ Create FOMO rules (no chasing 100%+ moves)

**"I oversized and couldn't think clearly"**
→ Reduce size until emotions are manageable

**"Everyone I follow was wrong too"**
→ Don't outsource thinking, do your own research

## Building a Loss Tolerance

Losses are part of the game. To survive long-term:
- Never risk more than 2-5% of portfolio on one narrative
- Expect 50% of narrative trades to be losers
- One 5-10x winner covers many 50% losses
- Losses are tuition, not failure

## The Recovery Mindset

After a loss:
- Don't revenge trade
- Don't immediately ape something else
- Take a breath, review what happened
- Come back with fresh eyes tomorrow`

      content: `# Building Your Narrative Edge

You've learned the theory. Now let's build a systematic approach that works for YOUR style. This lesson ties everything together.

## Your Narrative Playbook

Create a personal playbook that defines:
1. Where you source information
2. How you evaluate narratives
3. Your entry rules
4. Your position sizing
5. Your exit rules
6. Your review process

Write it down. A system beats gut instinct over time.

## The Daily Routine

Consistency matters more than intensity. Here's a template:

**Morning (15-20 min)**
- Scan Twitter lists for overnight narratives
- Check Telegram groups for any early calls
- Glance at DexScreener for notable movers
- Note anything interesting in your watchlist

**Midday (5-10 min)**
- Quick check on open positions
- Any breaking narratives?
- Only act if your rules say to act

**Evening (20-30 min)**
- Deeper research on watchlist items
- Review any trades from the day
- Prep for tomorrow

**Weekly (30-60 min)**
- Review all trades from the week
- Update your trading journal
- Adjust system based on learnings

## The Watchlist System

Don't ape everything. Maintain a structured watchlist:

**Tier 1: Active Positions**
- Tokens you own
- Clear thesis, targets, and stops written

**Tier 2: Ready to Enter**
- Narratives you've researched and validated
- Waiting for your entry setup
- Alerts set at key levels

**Tier 3: Watching**
- Interesting but not ready
- Needs more research or development
- Check back weekly

If it's not on your watchlist, you don't trade it.

## Position Sizing Framework

Standardize your sizing:

**Conviction Tiers:**
- High conviction (20-25 score): 3-5% of portfolio
- Medium conviction (15-19 score): 1-2% of portfolio
- Low conviction/speculation: 0.5% of portfolio

**Portfolio Limits:**
- Max 5 active narrative positions
- Max 15-20% of portfolio in narrative plays
- Keep 30%+ in stable assets (SOL, stables)

## The Pre-Trade Checklist

Before any narrative trade, confirm:

- [ ] Thesis written down (why this, why now)
- [ ] Narrative score calculated (15+ minimum)
- [ ] 3-source rule confirmed (on-chain, social, logical)
- [ ] No red flags found
- [ ] Entry price/range defined
- [ ] Position size set (within limits)
- [ ] Exit targets set (2x, 4x, moonbag)
- [ ] Stop loss / invalidation level set
- [ ] Written in trading journal

No trade without completing this checklist.

## Tracking Your Performance

What to track:
- Win rate (what % of narrative trades profit?)
- Average win vs average loss
- Best entries vs worst entries (what phase?)
- Time held vs outcome
- Total return on narrative trades

Review monthly. Look for patterns:
- "I always enter too late"
- "I hold losers too long"
- "My best trades are X type"

## Continuous Improvement

The market evolves. Your system must too.

**Monthly:**
- Review all trades
- Update rules that aren't working
- Add new sources if old ones decay

**Quarterly:**
- Bigger review of what's working
- Adjust position sizing based on results
- Update watchlist criteria

**Yearly:**
- Complete system audit
- Are you improving?
- What's the next level?

## Your Narrative Front Runner Identity

You're naturally good at:
- Spotting patterns early
- Moving fast when you see signal
- Connecting narratives to catalysts

Double down on these strengths. Build systems that enhance them.

Watch out for:
- FOMO'ing into late stage narratives
- Overtrading (not every narrative needs action)
- Ego (wanting to be "right" vs making money)

Build guardrails for your weaknesses.

## The Compound Effect

Narrative trading isn't about one big win. It's about:
- Consistent small edges
- Avoiding catastrophic losses
- Learning from every trade
- Compounding over months and years

Focus on the process. The results will follow.`
